## About the Collection

This collection is made to function as an archive for sources related to the Lesbian Lands movement of Southern Oregon. This movement is in relation to Back to the Lands movement of the 1960s and 1970s, and is based around lesbian femenist culture. This movement was pioneered by groups of lesbian women who were loooking to find alternative livestyles outside of patriarchal norm culture. Many of these communities were based in Southern Oregon, with over twelve still operating to this day, a near fifty years later.
